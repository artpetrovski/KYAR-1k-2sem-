    <p class="article1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
     industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
     since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
     scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>
     <h2 id="headtitle_two">Заголовок второго уровня</h2>
    <p class="article2"> Has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
     essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
     Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
     desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><br>
    <p class="article3">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots 
      in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p> <br>
      <h3 id="headtitle_three">Заголовок третьего уровня</h3>
      <p class="article4">Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked 
    up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going 
    through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p>
